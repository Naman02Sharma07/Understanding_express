understand internet using a movie?

so you are holding a phone and you send the the message or a call to someone so basically when you send the message that goes to you nearest tower through the packets of bits and bytes basically the message is continouslly travelling in the form of bits and bytes but we won't able to see it so when this data reach to the tower then it goes to your isp that is internet service provider which check your request whether it is valid or not then it convert that signal into the electrical signal and send it through thr optical wire through thr ocean to the server you reqested and then the sme process happen from their side as well data get back to you as a response

the datapack that the company or isp provide basically calculate how many bits of data already travel through the optical cable and the moment it calculate that you have reached you limit you get a message that say that you have already used your data 

in case of wifi what happen is first the pakets go to the router then to the nearest tower and vice versa

 nodejs allow us to run the code server but what really happen is when we pass the code in js it get converted into the c++.

 the V8 engine has the power to create a server but the js language don't have the power to create a server so, if we try to code for v8 engine we have to write it in c++. so this cde of c++ is covered by the wrapper of js. so this whole thing the wrapper that is in js and the core of the nodejs is c++ this combine is called the nodejs 

 when we write the code in js it get to the wrapper which convert this js code into the c++ and thus our core get created
